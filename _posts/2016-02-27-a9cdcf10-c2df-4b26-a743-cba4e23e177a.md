"Hello Sonny"... those were the last words my father ever spoke to me. Two words with so much meaning, such intensity. And love. You're a fine man, Dad, thanks for the path you created and everything you are.

Do we wait for those last words? Or can we treat each encounter as importantly, with such respect and understanding, as if it may be the final encounter?
